Hello there !

If you’ve landed here, first of all—welcome.
<br/><br/>

This blog is a space where I talk about the things I’m into: tech, games, builds, code experiments, and whatever else I feel like putting into words. Some posts might be deep dives, others just simple thoughts or updates.
<br/><br/>
Whether it’s a new project I’ve been building, research, or just rambling about GPUs—this is where it goes.
<br/><br/>
I'm not trying to be fancy or overly formal here. This is more of a personal archive—one that's honest, useful (hopefully), and very much still evolving.
<br/><br/>
Thanks for dropping in.
