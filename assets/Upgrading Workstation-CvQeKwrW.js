**Returning From Abroad**

Returning from my uni degree in Singapore, I took some time off to adjust and settle back in after spending a whole year in another country. Most days, I’d be watching hardware builds and projects, checking out new tech drops, or looking into some random game I wanted to try.

I still have a huge passion for competitive games like I did as a kid, but with different priorities now, that fire’s a bit lost in the wind.

<br> <br>

**My Old Setup**
<br>

I kept looking at the PC I built during lockdown — a humble **i3-10100F**, **GTX 1650 4GB**, and **16GB RAM** setup.  
In 2020, it got the job done. But four years later? Games were chugging, and even basic productivity tasks felt sluggish.

So I decided it was finally time to upgrade.

<br> <br>

**The Research Phase**
<br>

I did a ton of research on the Indian PC market. Prices are inflated, pre-builts are thrown together with low-quality or proprietary parts, and OLX is crawling with scams.  
Nehru Place seemed like a good shot, but after reading people’s experiences with third-party shops and sketchy components, I hit a wall.

After 3–4 months of digging, Amazon turned out to be my best bet. Surprisingly, the prices were lower than what local markets and online resellers were quoting.

<br> <br>

**Choosing the Right Combo**
<br>

Around this time, AMD's 7000 Series and AM5 platform dropped, and those chips were selling like hotcakes. I wanted a Ryzen 5 7600, but thanks to demand, the price went way out of my budget.

Intel’s 13th and 14th Gen chips weren’t exactly confidence-inspiring either — power draw issues, weird performance dips, and thermal concerns.

So with my budget, I narrowed it down to:
- -> AM4 with a Ryzen 5 5600/5600X  
- -> or Intel 12th Gen with an i5-12400F
<br><br>
The Intel chip supported DDR5, but pairing it with a decent GPU meant I'd have to settle for an RTX 3060.

On the AMD side, the 5600X + RTX 4060 combo looked better. Even though the 4060 had only 8GB VRAM, it pulled ahead in benchmarks.  
Sure, performance gains were in the single digits — but buying a two-generation-old card while the RTX 50 series was on the horizon? That didn’t sit right.

<br> <br>

**Final Build**
<br>

With CPU + GPU locked in, I checked the RAM QVL (Qualified Vendors List) for my Aorus B550M motherboard and picked out 2x16GB DIMMs.

To match the aesthetic, I stuck to all-white components and topped it off with 2TB of Crucial P3 NVMe storage — a massive upgrade from my old 1TB spinning rust.


<br> <br>

**Closing Thoughts**
<br>

This whole experience gave me a better understanding of just how fast tech moves.

The PC I once proudly built in 2020, which felt unstoppable back then, now struggles to keep up with modern games and workflows. In just four years, standards have completely shifted.

What used to be a "solid 1080p build" now barely holds up under modern engines, multi-tasking, or even a loaded Chrome session.  
It’s a reminder that in tech, standing still is falling behind — and adapting isn’t just an option, it’s the only way forward.
