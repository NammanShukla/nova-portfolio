A lightsail hosted website for the official IT Club of JCUS (James Cook University), The goal for this website was to spread information and make announcement for the club! We used wordpress as the choice of CMS as it was convinient for most people in the team and utilizing Amazon's Web Services namely Lightsail, to publish this site. The Domain Name was decided and bought by the whole team "iD8labs.org" which is a tribute to the predeccesors of the club as well as the logo mirage behind the homepage which was render by me in blender, this address was then routed to the static IP in a DNS zone to lead visitors to the site.\r
