Hello there !\r
\r
If you’ve landed here, first of all—welcome.\r
<br/><br/>\r
\r
This blog is a space where I talk about the things I’m into: tech, games, builds, code experiments, and whatever else I feel like putting into words. Some posts might be deep dives, others just simple thoughts or updates.\r
<br/><br/>\r
Whether it’s a new project I’ve been building, research, or just rambling about GPUs—this is where it goes.\r
<br/><br/>\r
I'm not trying to be fancy or overly formal here. This is more of a personal archive—one that's honest, useful (hopefully), and very much still evolving.\r
<br/><br/>\r
Thanks for dropping in.  \r
