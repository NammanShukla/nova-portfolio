This to-do list project evolved through four development stages, starting with a Vanilla JavaScript implementation featuring task management, filtering, status tracking, and multi-delete functionality. It was then rebuilt in React, refactored into reusable components with improved input handling and dynamic UI behavior. The third iteration integrated Redux to manage global state in a scalable, predictable, and debuggable way. The final version extended the app into a full-stack MERN application, using React for the frontend, Express and Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB Atlas for persistent storage, enabling complete CRUD operations across client and server.`;export{t as default};
