In 2021, I picked up a pretty solid laptop—an HP Pavilion rocking a Ryzen 7 5800H, 32GB RAM, RTX 3050 (mobile), and later bumped the storage to 2TB. Beast on paper. But like many others, it came with stock Windows. And over time… that just didn’t cut it anymore.\r
<br/><br/>\r
\r
My laptop’s still a killer machine—so why was it taking 45 seconds to make a new folder? Why was File Explorer crashing randomly? I did my fair share of tweaks, updates, fixes, regedits… but the root cause always circled back to Windows 11 being bloated for a setup like mine. I had to so many reasons to ditch windows.\r
\r
<br/><br/>\r
\r
- --> All the bloat and proprietary nonsense baked into the system\r
<br/><br/>\r
- --> Telemetry eating up resources in the background\r
<br/><br/>\r
- --> Barely any customization without sacrificing performance\r
\r
<br/><br/>\r
\r
Then came SteamOS from Valve, and suddenly Linux distros started popping into my radar—focused on performance, gaming, and productivity. I went down the rabbit hole of YouTube videos, Reddit threads, blog posts… and landed on Nobara OS.\r
\r
It’s basically Fedora under the hood, but with optimizations for gaming—especially for systems with NVIDIA GPUs (which is a pain point for most Linux distros).\r
\r
<br/><br/>\r
\r
So yeah—I nuked Windows. I’ve been using Nobara as my daily driver for a while now: coding, gaming, and ricing the system.\r
I’ll drop an update on this blog in a few months once I’ve racked up enough hours with on this distro.`;export{n as default};
