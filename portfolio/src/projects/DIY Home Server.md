This project documents the tranformation of an old gaming PC into a powerful home server. It runs Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, hosting a Plex media server and a Minecraft Server. Overcoming Double NAT restrictions, it uses Playit.gg for public access and Tailscale for secure remote access. A Raspberry Pi enables remote management.
