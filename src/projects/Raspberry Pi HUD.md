Developed a heads-up display for a Raspberry Pi 3B+ using Python’s Tkinter for the UI and a Flask server on a home server to fetch real-time system metrics like CPU/GPU temperatures, RAM, voltage, and uptime. The HUD also displays Plex server status, global time, and current weather using the OpenWeather API — all wrapped in a clean and informative UI designed for quick-glance monitoring.
