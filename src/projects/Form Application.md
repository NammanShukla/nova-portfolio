A basic forms application that takes user input for name, email, and password with built-in validation. Initially created using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to understand form behavior and logic.

Later, the entire project was rebuilt using React to better handle state management, modularize components, and improve responsiveness. This project helped reinforce the difference between traditional DOM handling and React's component-driven approach.
